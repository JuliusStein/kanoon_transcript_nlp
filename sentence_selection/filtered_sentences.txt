b' Addressing arguments on behalf of the appellant, Mr'
b' Deepti Goel, in her cross-examination clearly stated that hymen can be torn on account of many reasons like injuries during cycling or sports and in the background of sports activities, tearing of the hymen of the prosecutrix could be as a result of the same and not necessarily on account of alleged rape'
b' It is by far well recognised position that the condition of hymen being torn of the prosecutrix may not necessarily lead to infer previous sexual intercourse and conversely being hymen not torn also does not necessarily mean that there was no sexual intercourse'
b' Addressing arguments on behalf of the appellant, Mr'
b' Therefore in order to stop the appellant from raising his voice against her illicit relationships, she took the help of the prosecutrix in framing him in such a false case'
b' Lali, aunt (mausi) of the prosecutrix who was having illicit relationship with many persons and whenever the accused objected to the same, there used to be a quarrel between the accused and the said aunt and therefore in order to stop the appellant from raising his voice against her illicit relationships, she took the help of the prosecutrix in framing him in such a false case'
b" As can be seen from the aforesaid authoritative view of the experts in the medical field as referred to by the Hon'ble Division Bench and by Justice Verma Committee, the condition of hymen being torn of the prosecutrix may not necessarily mean a previous sexual intercourse and conversely the hymen being not torn also does not necessarily mean that there was no sexual intercourse"
b' In some of the females hymen can also be missing and in such cases also, mere absence of hymen will not necessarily prove the previous sexual intercourse and likewise will also not rule out the previous sexual assault'
b' It is also a settled legal position that for proving the offence of rape, penetrative sexual assault may not necessarily result in ejaculation and therefore in such cases there can hardly arise any question of stains of semen being there on the clothes of the victim and the perpetrator of the crime'
b' The print and television media, both public and private participants have to be partisans of this change'
b' Be it a rickshaw wala or a jhuggi dweller to the top-notch people in the society and, therefore, the people can be educated about these laws through SMSs as well'
b' He stated that PW-14 made search of the accused Sabhajeet, however, he was not found present at his address'
b' However, the fact that the prosecutrix was close to Ashutosh Maurya, does not necessarily exclude the possibility that the appellant had raped her as alleged'
b' Aforethought does not necessarily imply premeditation, but implies intention which must necessarily precede the act intended'
b' Having stated the above, this Court is of the view that even if the Trial Court was of the view that it would not be apposite to frame charges under Section 270 of the IPC, the same did not necessarily warrant that charges be framed under Section 307 of the IPC'
b' PW23 LHC Sarita forwarded the same alongwith rukka to HAG Rajinder (PW9) for registration of case'
b'2018 framing charge as well as consequent proceedings arising therefrom, is allowed to sustain, accused shall be unnecessarily put to the ordeals of protracted trial, which ultimately may lead to acquittal of the accused'
b' The CWC, thereupon, addressed a communication (titled an \xe2\x80\x95Order\xe2\x80\x96), dated 13th February, 2013, to the Station House Officer (SHO), PS Shahbad Dairy, drawing his attention to the above extracted communication from the CSI and requesting him to intervene'
b" On 13th June, 2013, PW-14 SI Satish Kumar sought information, from the Superintendent of the Ashiyana Boys' Home, inter alia regarding the complete address, contact number and other particulars of Bijender"
b' The Superintendent responded, vide letter dated 15th June, 2013, providing the said information, including the permanent address of Bijender as well as the situs of his employment at that point of time'
b' The duty of the court is to assimilate, analyse and evaluate the evidence available before it, and indicate the conclusion to which such evidence necessarily points'
b' Personal perceptions and predilections, regarding the accused, and his involvement, or otherwise, in the perpetration of the offence, have necessarily to take a backseat, if the rule of law is to be allowed to prevail'
b" The spark that ignited the flame, in the present case, may be said to be the letter, dated 4th February, 2013 supra, addressed by the CSI to the CWC, which refers to the disclosure, by \xe2\x80\x97S', of the fact that he had been sexually abused at the Ashiyana Boys' Home"
b' This aspect is underscored in the last sentence of the said letter, which exhorts the Chairperson of the CWC to take further action to stop \xe2\x80\x95such kind of activities among children\xe2\x80\x96'
b' Kapoor, contends - and I am inclined to agree therewith - that the total exclusion, from the present proceedings, of the efforts made, if any, to trace Bijender or, if he had been so traced, to disclose the outcome thereof, the statement, if any, recorded from the said Bijender or, if no such statement was recorded, the reason for not doing so, necessarily invites an inference adverse to the prosecution'
b' Kapoor, from the prosecution - a lacuna which must necessarily, yet again, resulting in an adverse inference, detrimental to the prosecution'
b'252/2016 Page 50 of 69 boys, necessarily requires to be attributed to the delay in the recording of their statements, during which period this Court had already noted, in its order dated 15th February, 2013, that the appellant was also being treated as an accused, merits serious consideration'
b' In order for circumstantial evidence to constitute the basis of conviction, it has necessarily to be established that the circumstances are such as would create an unbroken chain, which leads only to the conclusion that the accused is guilty of having committed the offence, and none else'

b" In such circumstances, the presence of the appellant's semen, on the jeans and the handkerchief of the prosecutrix X, read with the medical evidence, to the effect that there was a white, semen-like discharge coming out of her vagina, and the evidence of the prosecutrix, under Section 164 of the Cr"

b' Were the present case to be purely one of circumstantial evidence, perhaps, such a yawning gap might, by itself, have been fatal to the case of the prosecution, as it is one of the fundamental principles of appreciation of circumstantial evidence, that the circumstances, which are proved, must form an unbroken chain, and that the benefit of any missing links in such a chain must necessarily enure in favour of the accused, and vitiate the case of the prosecution'
b' At this stage, before proceeding further, one may directly address the allegation of \xe2\x80\x95gang rape\xe2\x80\x96, as levelled against the appellant, and his two \xe2\x80\x95unknown\xe2\x80\x96 compatriots, by the prosecutrix'
b' \xe2\x80\x95Gang rape\xe2\x80\x96 necessarily involves rape, of a woman, by one or more persons'
b' If nothing else, the presence of semen in a condom does not necessarily indicate penetration'

b' She also admitted that the appellant was wearing a knicker and baniyan at that time'
b' The learned additional public prosecutor has also relied on Ravi @ Nehru (supra) in which case the prosecutrix aged about 5 years while going to her aunt\xe2\x80\x9fs house along with other children was taken by the accused to his bed room where prosecutrix\xe2\x80\x9fs underwear was removed and the accused also removed his pants and placed the prosecutrix on his lap and pressed his male organ on her female organ'
b' In this case, the High Court had acquitted the accused holding that the statement of the prosecutrix was not corroborated by the evidence of the doctor, who examined her as there were no external injuries and there were no blood stains on her dress nor there was any injury on her female organ though hymen was ruptured and there was no fresh bleeding from the private parts'
b' 928 of 2008 Page 22 of 36 that non presence of blood stains on the victim\xe2\x80\x9fs vaginal part and on her wearing apparel will not make much difference as there was categorical testimony of her mother and two other witnesses that the prosecutrix was given bath and her vagina and wearing apparel were washed before taking her to the doctor'

b'P/l, the prosecutrix has further stated that she had washed those clothes which she was wearing at the time of commission of rape with her by the accused appellant'
b' Its nature and extent must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged'
b'2000, the accused appellant first made her undressed and, thereafter, committed rape with her and thereafter, she herself put on the clothes'
b' (iv) That the fact that on both incidents of alleged rape, she was first undressed and she herself put on the clothes, further goes to show that she was a consenting party'
b' (xi) That the prosecutrix washed out her clothes, which she was wearing at the time of alleged incidents of rape and thus, the corroborative evidence of clothes stained either with blood or semen is missing in this case and from this point of view also, theory of rape cannot be accepted'
b' Had there been any stains of semen or blood on the clothes, which she was wearing at the time of alleged incidents of rape, they would have gone long way to prove the case of the prosecution about commission of rape and in absence of that, negatives the case of the prosecution'

b'96, he was having only underwear on his body and his pant and shirt were found in the bathroom on the ground floor where dead body of the deceased Radha was found'
b' The autopsy surgeon had opined the cause of his death to be shock as a result of ante-mortem injuries to the internal organs and blood vessels likely to be produced by a sharp pointed weapon'
b' On internal examination of the dead body the autopsy surgeon had found one stab wound in the lower part of front of right side of the neck and that injury was considered to be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature'

b' He submitted that the clothes of accused Rajinder @ Raju, Sunil Kumar, Raj Kumar @ Raju and Jai Kishan @ Jaickey which they were wearing at the time of their arrest were also seized by the police for detection of blood and when those clothes were examined at Forensic Science Laboratory human blood was detected on all the clothes about which none of the accused has offered any explanation'
b" On the pant which accused Rajinder was wearing at the time of his arrest human blood of 'A' group was found while the group of human blood found on his shirt could not be found out as the blood gave no reaction"
b' It was also contended that in any case it was also highly improbable that the accused would be wearing blood stained clothes after a week of the incident'
b' that their clothes which they were found to be wearing at the time of their arrest were found to be blood stained'
b' According to the prosecutrix, her blood stained underwear was removed by the doctor, PW-1 as she had been wearing the same'
b' The Trial Court has also noticed that it has not been established that the pant which he was wearing had a zip or the accused had opened the buttons of the trouser before allegedly committing the rape'
b' Had the version of wiping out the blood which had started oozing on account of insertion of finger by the accused had been established, the absence of blood stains of the prosecutrix on the pants of the accused could be explained'
b' If the theory of wiping out the blood which oozed from the vagina has not been established, then it is improbable that the accused committed rape without removing his pants and no blood stains could have come on his half pants'
b' Her two children, the son named Bharat and the daughter named Sarika also resided with her in the same house'
b' SHO Hira Lal, also reached the spot and found that on the first floor, the dead bodies of Bharat and Sarika were lying on the bed'
b' A television set was also found lying on the top most stair of the first floor'
b' The crime team was called for and on investigation 9-10 iron rods of the iron jaal on the top portion of the courtyard were found to be cut and bent downwards'
b' Thereafter, the postmortem report was collected and on perusal of the postmortem report of the deceased Sarika, it transpired that the Doctor had opined that sexual offence prior to the death was a possibility'
b'A 670/2007 & 826/2007 Page 5 of 64 Exhibits of both the accused and Sarika were sent to CDFD, Hyderabad for DNA testing and the remaining exhibits were sent to FSL, Malviya Nagar'
b'A 670/2007 & 826/2007 Page 6 of 64 of the weapon of offence viz the belt used for strangulating one of the victims as per the endorsement of the doctor who conducted the postmortem; the recovery of the aari, blade of aari and rope used by the accused persons for entry in the house after cutting the iron jaal from the house and the DNA Test Report according to which the biological fluid present on the clothes of the victim, Sarika matched the DNA of the accused Vinay Kumar, the Trial Court concluded that the guilt of the appellants was established beyond any reasonable doubt'
b' According to the learned counsel if indeed the accused persons were behaving suspiciously, then it is unusual conduct on the part of PW-3 to have not stopped and enquired from them or in the very least to have at least gone to the house of PW-2 to check, if everything was alright'
b' There is absolutely no evidence regarding under whose custody the samples and garments of Sarika remained during the intervening period'
b' As per the learned counsel even though the vaginal swab, vaginal smear and nail clippings of Sarika the victim was preserved and handed over to the police by the doctor during post mortem, however the vaginal smear and the nail clipping which Crl'
b' Thus the learned counsel contended that since the 18 plastic dibas also included the clothes of Sarika as well as her undergarments which were sent for DNA analysis, there is a possibility that the same could have not been deposited and therefore there was every possibility of it being tampered with'
b' As per the learned counsel the malkhana register does not specify the items that were sent to CFSL, Malviya Nagar and CDFD, Hyderabad, hence there is a lot of ambiguity and there is doubt impressed upon the fact that the garments of Sarika and PM Blood gauge were sent to FSL, Malviya Nagar and CDFD Hyderabad, simultaneously, which is not rationally possible'
b' Therefore, it is contended that there are clear manipulations made in the arrest memo as even the entry in the memo has been made with two different pens and while the date on the top is mentioned as 19th August, 2002 the date in column no'
b' The learned counsel further contended that PW-2 had categorically stated that in her presence none of the articles were seized from the room however, as per PW-27 Ombir Singh, a belt, an iron rod, an empty sweet box, from the room and three ropes, one aari and four blades were recovered from the roof top'
b' Regarding the offence of rape the learned counsel for the state has contended that as per the DNA report the biological fluid present on the clothes of Sarika was a source of exhibits of the appellant Vinay, however, the same wasn\xe2\x80\x9ft a source of exhibits of the accused Munish and thus it is contended that the scientific evidence of rape before murder by the appellant Vinay stands proved beyond all reasonable doubt'
b' As argued by the learned counsel for the appellants, if indeed PW-3 had seen the appellants running out of the house, he should have become suspicious and should have stopped and enquired from them as to the reason for their presence at the spot'
b' These are not such circumstances which would have made PW-3 suspicious so as to stop them or enquire anything from them'
b' Merely because he knew the said appellant does not mean that he should have stopped him to ask him as to why he is walking fast or running'
b' Thus as per the counsel, the surplus of DNA samples could have been easily used to manipulate the evidence by means of tampering with the clothes of the victim Sarita and Crl'
b' the semen present on the source of the clothes of the victim Sarika is comparable with the blood sample of appellant Vinay and it is not the case of the appellant that during his medical examination his semen samples were seized by the prosecution'
b' The clothes of the deceased, Sarika were examined by the CDFD'
b' The learned counsel contended that since one of the 18 items could have also been the clothes of the deceased Sarika, therefore, tampering of the same cannot be rules out'
b' DESCRIPTION OF PARCELS & CONDITION OF SEAL/S THAT WERE SENT TO THE FSL, ROHINI AS PER THE REPORT: PW 29/A:  Thus from the above it is clear that none of the items that were sent to the CFSL were sent to the CDFD, Hyderabad and that the 18 dibas do not include the polythene bag containing the clothes of the victim, Sarika'
b' The learned counsel for the appellant has not been able to show any missing link in the `chain of custody\xe2\x80\x9f so as to disbelieve or discredit the DNA samples or the sealed clothes of the deceased Sarika that were send to the CDFD, Hyderabad, for the purpose of DNA testing, as from the point of its seizure to its submission before the CDFD no tampering has been established nor can be inferred conclusively in the facts and circumstances'
b' Deposition of PW-29 who analyzed the DNA samples and matched the DNA samples of appellant Vinay with that of the blood found on the clothes of the victim Sarika is very material'
b'29/A had deposed that the postmortem blood and vaginal swab of the deceased Sarika did not yield DNA suitable for analysis'
b' The DNA from the clothes of deceased Sarika were compared with the blood sample of Crl'
b'A 670/2007 & 826/2007 Page 45 of 64 appellants Vinay Kumar and Munish and on comparison the DNA profile and biological fluids on the clothes of deceased Sarika was found to be comparable with the DNA profile of blood of Vinay Kumar, however, the biological fluids from the clothes of the deceased Sarika was not the source of blood sample of the appellant Munish'
b' clothes of deceased Sarika did not match the source of blood sample of Munish, the implications of which shall be dealt with hereinafter'
b' Thus the injuries on the body of the deceased, Sarika in addition to the DNA report that matched the DNA of the appellant Vinay with the Crl'
b'A 670/2007 & 826/2007 Page 51 of 64 biological fluid (semen) found on the clothes of the deceased and the opinion of PW-7 stating that sexual assault prior to murder cannot be ruled out, all point towards the undeniable inference that the appellant Vinay had raped the deceased, Sarika and then murdered her by strangulation'
b' Some of the witness including PW-2 who had first reached the spot deposed regarding the helmet on top of the TV set'
b' In fact PW-2 had categorically mentioned about the TV set found on top of the stairs but she didn\xe2\x80\x9ft mention about any helmet on top of the TV set'
b' Even the arrest memo of the appellant is inconsistent since at the top portion the date mentioned is 19th August, 2002 while the "date of arrest" column mentions the date as 20th August, 2002'
b' Regarding the arrest memo, normally the date of the FIR is mentioned at the top portion while the column for the date of arrest mentions the date on which the suspect is arrested'
b' Hence in view of the evidence of PW-3, the recoveries affected at the instance of appellant and the scientific evidence of the DNA of the appellant matching with the biological fluid found on the clothes of the deceased, Sarika as per the CDFD Report, and the motive as established by the prosecution the chain of circumstantial evidence is complete and is substantial in inculpating the guilt of the appellant, Crl'

b' She deposed that in the month of January 1994 respondent Parveen called her to Preet Vihar Bus Stop and asked her to go on a pleasure stroll and took her to Janpath at the house of respondent Bittoo'
b' Further she deposed that when she asked for her jeans from Parveen, he forced her to allow his friend Bittoo to repeat a similar act and when she refused the same, both Parveen and Bitto used force against her and Bittoo pressed her mouth and committed rape on her'
b'1994, she received a phone call from Parveen who asked her to meet at the Nirman Vihar Bus Stop'
b' They used to meet frequently and mostly at the bus stop'
b') \xef\x82\xb7 Accused Parveen had called me at the bus stop of Preet Vihar and asked me to go on some pleasure stroll'
b'PW1/A so recorded) \xef\x82\xb7 I told the police that I asked for my jeans but the same was not given to me and I was compelled to allow Bittoo to have intercourse with me; on my refusal both of them used force against me, the accused Bittoo pressed my mouth and made me lie forcibly on the ground'

b' In view of what we have discussed hereinabove, we allow the appeals of appellants Parvej Ansari, Kailash Soni, Mahesh Ludhiyani and Harish Tolani'
b' Closing address by the defence was submitted holding the accused to be guilty on al the charges'
b' Amongst other arguments being addressed, counsel for the petitioner states that as already stated no offence under the Army Act was triable as offence of rape is a civil offence under the Army Act and is to be tried by the civil court u/Section 63 of the Army Act'
b" The main argument as addressed is that the offence as complaint do not fall under the definition of 'adultery' and even if the statement of the prosecutirx or her husband is believed, it will not amount to the offence of the adultery"
b' All the accused persons were wearing blood stained clothes, which were taken possession of'
b' Appellant Shiv Singh was armed with a knife, Appellant Raghubir Singh was armed with an iron pipe and Appellant Shri Prakash was armed with an iron rod (sariya)'
b' Shri Prakash and Raghubir Singh inflicted blows on the head and chest of Radhey Shyam with the iron pipe and sariya as a result of which he sustained some injuries'
b' Similarly, in Dasari Siva Prasad Reddy v'
b' While dwelling on the actual attack as described by Radhey Shyam, it was submitted by Learned Counsel that the inflicting of a sariya blow on Radhey Shyam by Shri Prakash was an improvement over what Radhey Shyam had stated before the police during investigations'
b' As per the site plan, Raghubir Singh is shown to have attacked Radhey Shyam with an iron pipe and there was nothing to show that Shri Prakash attacked Radhey Shyam with a sariya'
b' This by itself is inadequate, but if it is coupled with his statement given under Section 161 of the CrPC, wherein Radhey Shyam had not stated that Shri Prakash had hit him with a sariya, then it is quite clear that there is an improvement between the statement made during investigations and during the trial'
b' State of Uttar Pradesh (1998) 7 SCC 300, the Supreme Court observed as follows: Though establishing common intention is a difficult task for the prosecution, yet, however difficult it may be, the prosecution has to establish by evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that there was a plan or meeting of mind of all the assailants to commit the offence, be it prearranged or on the spur of the moment but it must necessarily be before the commission of the crime'
b' This witness stated that the Appellants were wearing bloodstained clothes and possession was taken of these bloodstained clothes'
b' The evidence in this regard, as per the investigating officer, was that he had received secret information to the effect that the appellant was seen fleeing away wearing only his undergarments'
b' With regard to the recovery of bloodstained clothes that the Appellants were wearing, it was submitted that it is extremely unlikely that three or four days after the murder, the Appellants would still be roaming around wearing bloodstained clothes'
b' We find it extremely difficult to believe that a person who is involved in such a serious crime like murder would still be wearing clothes which are bloodstained even four days after the murder which fact we find is opposed to normal human conduct'
b' The State , which was a slightly more extreme case where the accused was arrested after 11 days of the occurrence and was still wearing bloodstained clothes'
b' It was stated as follows: Hence it is a fallacious impression that when recovery is effected pursuant to any statement made by the accused the document prepared by the investigating officer contemporaneous with such recovery must necessarily be attested by the independent witnesses'
b' However, we are of the opinion that the entire second part of the case is rather doubtful beginning with the arrest of the Appellants while they were wearing bloodstained clothes'

b' Counsel further submitted that PW7 Sarita (mother of the prosecutrix) has deposed that the prosecutrix was playing near the Surya Temple, which is at a little distance from her house'
b' Counsel has further referred the deposition of PW7, Sarita, mother of prosecutrix, who has deposed in cross-examination that Satpal was the employer of her husband'
b' She stopped visiting it after this incident'
b' Counsel has also pointed out that underwear of the prosecutrix stated to have been thrown in the garbage and only lifted again by PW7 Sarita, mother of the prosecutrix next day and handed over to the police'

b' On the contrary, it appears that she accompanied the appellant in the train and also visited with him to the market to purchase wearing items viz'
b', petticoat and blouse'
b' Her two children, the son named Bharat and the daughter named Sarika also resided with her in the same house'
b' SHO Hira Lal, also reached the spot and found that on the first floor, the dead bodies of Bharat and Sarika were lying on the bed'
b' A television set was also found lying on the top most stair of the first floor'
b' The crime team was called for and on investigation 9-10 iron rods of the iron jaal on the top portion of the courtyard were found to be cut and bent downwards'
b' Thereafter, the postmortem report was collected and on perusal of the postmortem report of the deceased Sarika, it transpired that the Doctor had opined that sexual offence prior to the death was a possibility'
b'A 670/2007 & 826/2007 Page 5 of 64 Exhibits of both the accused and Sarika were sent to CDFD, Hyderabad for DNA testing and the remaining exhibits were sent to FSL, Malviya Nagar'
b'A 670/2007 & 826/2007 Page 6 of 64 of the weapon of offence viz the belt used for strangulating one of the victims as per the endorsement of the doctor who conducted the postmortem; the recovery of the aari, blade of aari and rope used by the accused persons for entry in the house after cutting the iron jaal from the house and the DNA Test Report according to which the biological fluid present on the clothes of the victim, Sarika matched the DNA of the accused Vinay Kumar, the Trial Court concluded that the guilt of the appellants was established beyond any reasonable doubt'
b' According to the learned counsel if indeed the accused persons were behaving suspiciously, then it is unusual conduct on the part of PW-3 to have not stopped and enquired from them or in the very least to have at least gone to the house of PW-2 to check, if everything was alright'
b' There is absolutely no evidence regarding under whose custody the samples and garments of Sarika remained during the intervening period'
b' As per the learned counsel even though the vaginal swab, vaginal smear and nail clippings of Sarika the victim was preserved and handed over to the police by the doctor during post mortem, however the vaginal smear and the nail clipping which Crl'
b' Thus the learned counsel contended that since the 18 plastic dibas also included the clothes of Sarika as well as her undergarments which were sent for DNA analysis, there is a possibility that the same could have not been deposited and therefore there was every possibility of it being tampered with'
b' As per the learned counsel the malkhana register does not specify the items that were sent to CFSL, Malviya Nagar and CDFD, Hyderabad, hence there is a lot of ambiguity and there is doubt impressed upon the fact that the garments of Sarika and PM Blood gauge were sent to FSL, Malviya Nagar and CDFD Hyderabad, simultaneously, which is not rationally possible'
b' Therefore, it is contended that there are clear manipulations made in the arrest memo as even the entry in the memo has been made with two different pens and while the date on the top is mentioned as 19th August, 2002 the date in column no'
b' The learned counsel further contended that PW-2 had categorically stated that in her presence none of the articles were seized from the room however, as per PW-27 Ombir Singh, a belt, an iron rod, an empty sweet box, from the room and three ropes, one aari and four blades were recovered from the roof top'
b' Regarding the offence of rape the learned counsel for the state has contended that as per the DNA report the biological fluid present on the clothes of Sarika was a source of exhibits of the appellant Vinay, however, the same wasn\xe2\x80\x9ft a source of exhibits of the accused Munish and thus it is contended that the scientific evidence of rape before murder by the appellant Vinay stands proved beyond all reasonable doubt'
b' As argued by the learned counsel for the appellants, if indeed PW-3 had seen the appellants running out of the house, he should have become suspicious and should have stopped and enquired from them as to the reason for their presence at the spot'
b' These are not such circumstances which would have made PW-3 suspicious so as to stop them or enquire anything from them'
b' Merely because he knew the said appellant does not mean that he should have stopped him to ask him as to why he is walking fast or running'
b' Thus as per the counsel, the surplus of DNA samples could have been easily used to manipulate the evidence by means of tampering with the clothes of the victim Sarita and Crl'
b' the semen present on the source of the clothes of the victim Sarika is comparable with the blood sample of appellant Vinay and it is not the case of the appellant that during his medical examination his semen samples were seized by the prosecution'
b' The clothes of the deceased, Sarika were examined by the CDFD'
b' The learned counsel contended that since one of the 18 items could have also been the clothes of the deceased Sarika, therefore, tampering of the same cannot be rules out'
b' DESCRIPTION OF PARCELS & CONDITION OF SEAL/S THAT WERE SENT TO THE FSL, ROHINI AS PER THE REPORT: PW 29/A:  Thus from the above it is clear that none of the items that were sent to the CFSL were sent to the CDFD, Hyderabad and that the 18 dibas do not include the polythene bag containing the clothes of the victim, Sarika'
b' The learned counsel for the appellant has not been able to show any missing link in the `chain of custody\xe2\x80\x9f so as to disbelieve or discredit the DNA samples or the sealed clothes of the deceased Sarika that were send to the CDFD, Hyderabad, for the purpose of DNA testing, as from the point of its seizure to its submission before the CDFD no tampering has been established nor can be inferred conclusively in the facts and circumstances'
b' Deposition of PW-29 who analyzed the DNA samples and matched the DNA samples of appellant Vinay with that of the blood found on the clothes of the victim Sarika is very material'
b'29/A had deposed that the postmortem blood and vaginal swab of the deceased Sarika did not yield DNA suitable for analysis'
b' The DNA from the clothes of deceased Sarika were compared with the blood sample of Crl'
b'A 670/2007 & 826/2007 Page 45 of 64 appellants Vinay Kumar and Munish and on comparison the DNA profile and biological fluids on the clothes of deceased Sarika was found to be comparable with the DNA profile of blood of Vinay Kumar, however, the biological fluids from the clothes of the deceased Sarika was not the source of blood sample of the appellant Munish'
b' clothes of deceased Sarika did not match the source of blood sample of Munish, the implications of which shall be dealt with hereinafter'
b' Thus the injuries on the body of the deceased, Sarika in addition to the DNA report that matched the DNA of the appellant Vinay with the Crl'
b'A 670/2007 & 826/2007 Page 51 of 64 biological fluid (semen) found on the clothes of the deceased and the opinion of PW-7 stating that sexual assault prior to murder cannot be ruled out, all point towards the undeniable inference that the appellant Vinay had raped the deceased, Sarika and then murdered her by strangulation'
b' Some of the witness including PW-2 who had first reached the spot deposed regarding the helmet on top of the TV set'
b' In fact PW-2 had categorically mentioned about the TV set found on top of the stairs but she didn\xe2\x80\x9ft mention about any helmet on top of the TV set'
b' Even the arrest memo of the appellant is inconsistent since at the top portion the date mentioned is 19th August, 2002 while the "date of arrest" column mentions the date as 20th August, 2002'
b' Regarding the arrest memo, normally the date of the FIR is mentioned at the top portion while the column for the date of arrest mentions the date on which the suspect is arrested'
b' Hence in view of the evidence of PW-3, the recoveries affected at the instance of appellant and the scientific evidence of the DNA of the appellant matching with the biological fluid found on the clothes of the deceased, Sarika as per the CDFD Report, and the motive as established by the prosecution the chain of circumstantial evidence is complete and is substantial in inculpating the guilt of the appellant, Crl'

b' For the semen stains found on the petticoat, cervical swab and vaginal swab of the prosecutrix, it is contended that in the absence of blood group examination of the Appellant, it cannot be connected to him'
b'PW9/F and 9/G human semen was detected on the vaginal swab, cervical swab and the petticoat of the prosecutrix and also on the underwear of the Appellant'
b' 447/1999 Page 8 of 14 swab, petticoat and underwear were of "A" Group'
b'e, the Appellant being found passing in front of the house of the prosecutrix when PW2 reached after half an hour of leaving her alone and the presence of "A" group human semen in her cervical swab and petticoat also found on the underwear of the Appellant, prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant committed the offence of trespass and rape on the prosecutrix'
b' The mere circumstance of group "A" semen being found on the underwear of the Appellant and the petticoat and cervical swab of the prosecutrix is not sufficient to rule out every other hypothesis of the innocence of the Appellant'
b' It was further contended that there are other several material contradictions between the testimony of witnesses examined by prosecution as according to the prosecution version accused was wearing pant and shirt at the time of alleged incident whereas PW2 deposed that accused was wearing only lungi and he was not even wearing underwear'
b' But when PW2 graced the witness box, she did not support the prosecution case by deposing that when she got up, she saw that lungi of accused was down and her daughter was at his penis and further deposed that accused was not wearing any underwear'
b' Now coming to the next question what was accused wearing at the time of alleged incident? 40'
b' PW2 in her examination-in-chief categorically deposed that accused was wearing a lungi at the time of incident and at that time his lungi was down'
b' In other words, prosecution did not dispute the fact that accused was wearing a lungi at the time of alleged incident'
b' Thus, as per the testimony of PW2, accused was wearing lungi at the time of alleged incident and same was opened from front side'
b' In other words, by saying that accused was wearing lungi, PW2 intended to say that it was possible SC No'
b' But her testimony is not supported by PW7, investigating officer who categorically deposed that accused was wearing pant and shirt and he was not wearing lungi'
b' Similarly, PW6 deposed that accused was wearing pant and shirt'
b' Admittedly, PW2 did not allege in her complaint that accused was wearing lungi or that his lungi was down or that lungi was opened from front side'
b' If accused was wearing lungi and it was opened from front side, complainant should have told the same to the police'
b' As already stated that both the sub-inspectors categorically deposed that accused was found wearing pant and shirt and not lungi'
b' If accused was wearing pant and shirt as deposed by PW6 and PW7, it further casts a doubt over the testimony of PW2 that victim was at the penis of the accused'

b' From reading of the disclosure memo, it comes out that the accused, while being in custody of police since 05-08- 2010, made a disclosure statement to the effect that he had concealed one ladies Shalwar, one ladies underwear and one pair of plastic chapels in bushes near a Cabin under Digiana Pulli and that he only knew that these were kept concealed there'

b"2019; that, the autopsy report disclosed fracture of skull, suggesting a case of homicide; that, on arrest the appellant confessed his guilt; that, on his disclosure statement, there was recovery of hair and oil bottle from the spot which, when read with forensic evidence, confirms appellant's presence at the scene of crime thereby, completing the chain of circumstances and, in absence of plausible explanation from the appellant, pointed towards his guilt of having committed the offences for which he had been charged by ruling out all other exculpatory hypothesis"
b' But when he had reached the spot, the police were stopping people from entering the house'
b' He had conducted the autopsy he proved the postmortem report and its contents, which have already been noticed above'
b' He proved various papers in connection with inquest proceedings and with regard to sealing and forwarding the body for autopsy'
b' When the vehicle reached near Nazil, he started to walk fast and when he was requested to stop, he fired at the police'

b'2019 the body of the deceased was recovered from a Kothri on the first floor of a semi-built house; (c) the autopsy report suggests that the deceased died a homicidal death; (d) that the autopsy report confirms that death could have been caused on or about the time when the deceased was last seen with the accused-appellant; (e) that on the disclosure made by the accused-appellant and at his pointing out hair strands were recovered from that Kothri which, upon DNA matching, were confirmed to be of the appellant; (f) likewise, a bottle of oil bearing finger prints of the appellant was also recovered at the instance of the appellant from another place of that house, which confirms the presence of the appellant at that place'
b'2019 her mummified body (with all organs and orifices missing) was discovered lying in a Kothri on the first floor of a semi-built house; and (iii) that from the autopsy report dated 23'
b' Further, this recovery has been explained by the appellant in his statement recorded under section 313 CrPC by stating that he had been inflicted with two gun shot injuries, one on each leg, from a close range to extract his confession and to force him to sign recovery memorandum when, in fact, there was neither any disclosure made by him nor any recovery from the spot, rather, his hair were pulled to show them as hair strands recovered from the spot; and that the entire exercise is a paper work of the police to build a case against him as he was unnecessarily shot at in a false encounter'

b' In the said entry it was noted that a 11-year-old girl who was around 4 feet in height, fair coloured and round faced, wearing black hawaii chappal and yellow coloured salwar suit and who was studying in Class V had gone missing'
b' He noticed that a salwar and a kurta were present on the body and skeletisation of skull was present'
b' According to PW-15, the Appellant first took them to his own house at 57, Bapu Camp, Mandi and got recovered a yellow colour shirt of check design which he purportedly was wearing at the time of the incident'
b' The shirt was purportedly having human hairs on it'
b' The shirt was then kept in the pulanda and sealed with the seal of \xe2\x80\x9eVJ\xe2\x80\x9f and seized under memo Ex'
b' After his medical examination was undertaken, the Appellant apparently again took the police to the area of Mandi Pahadi and from near the bushes got recovered the underwear which he was wearing at the time of the incident'
b' Further, a DNA profile could not be generated even from the shirt seized from the Appellant which appears to have long filamentous material like hair attached to its buttons'
b' As far as the circumstance of the Appellant absconding after the incident, it is seen that he is a resident of the same area and the only evidence that has come forth is that as a result of some information passed on by a secret informer, the police apprehended him at the Mandi bus stop, which is again in the same area itself'
b' The next important circumstance that is relied upon by the prosecution is the disclosure statement made by the Appellant leading to the recovery of four articles: (i) the ear ring of the deceased; (ii) the chappal of the deceased; (iii) the underwear of the accused; and (iv) the shirt of the accused'
b' As regards the recovery of the shirt, as already noticed, it was recovered from the Appellant\xe2\x80\x9fs house and was not therefore secreted away'

b' He deposed that one lady official in a civil dress told the officials of CWC that he was not the real grandfather of the victim and was the step grandfather and hence, the custody could not be granted to him'
b' Thus, the principal question to be addressed is whether her statements and her testimony are reliable and establish beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellant had committed the offence for which he was charged'
b' In her statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC, she stated that she was feeding her sister (Bhawna) under the sun on the top (main apni bahan Bhawna ko dhoop me upar khila rahi thi)'
b' While lodging the FIR the complainant had also given the description of his daughter as well of the school uniform she was wearing at the time of leaving home for her school'
b'PW5/A wherein not only name of the appellant has been correctly mentioned but even his parentage and permanent address is also correctly given by father of the prosecutrix'
b' The fact that in the FIR her father has mentioned the name, parentage and permanent address of the appellant, is sufficient to prove that not only the prosecutrix but even her father knew that the appellant was a Muslim with the name Jakir'
b"423 of the Trial Court Record, there is copy of transfer certificate issued by Shivam Adarsh Vidya Mandir, Padli (Sikrai) Dosa which records the name of the prosecutrix, her father's name, permanent address, date of birth as 16"

b' The prosecution case itself is that on the same night both the accused, namely, Lala and Sunil, came to the house of Mukesh and their wearing apparels which had blood stains were burnt by Mukesh on the same night'
b' The said burnt cloth pieces were also very small in size and, therefore, the same cannot be held to be the same wearing apparels as were used by the two accused persons which are stated to be blood stained'
b' The main difficulty in the case is that the evidence regarding the recovery of blood stained axe and blood stained shirt and dhoti is not very satisfactory and the courts below were wrong in admitting certain statements alleged to have been made by the appellant in connection with that recovery'
b' This witness said that that a little before the recovery the Sub-Inspector of Police took the appellant into custody and interrogated him; then the appellant gave out that the axe with which the murder had been committed and his blood stained shirt and dhoti were in the house and the appellant was prepared to produce them'
b' Nor was the alleged statement of the appellant that the blood stained shirt and dhoti belonged to him a statement which led to any discovery within the meaning of S'

b' The boy (in the white T-shirt) asked why he could not get liquor, particularly when they (Malini and her friend) were drinking'

b' The factum of the dog leading a trail and standing by the side of the accused or catching hold of the accused through his dress cannot be considered to be a substantive piece of evidence nor it can be a link in the chain to convict the accused'
b' The main grounds to assail the findings of the learned trial court taken in the present appeal inter alia are that the appellant was turned out of her matrimonial home in three wearings after she was mercilessly beaten by the respondent husband and this aspect was completely ignored by the learned trial court; the learned trial court also misread the evidence and assumed certain evidence which in fact does not exist; the allegations leveled by the petitioner husband in the divorce petition are contrary to the stand taken by him in his petition filed under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act; the respondent husband had started creating evidence in his favour after a complaint was filed by the father of the appellant against him with the concerned police station; the learned trial court wrongly placed reliance on the FIR and the MLC, which documents could not be proved by the respondent in accordance with law; FAO 443/2000 Page 2 of 53 no specific allegations of cruelty were leveled by the respondent against the appellant till the date she remained in the matrimonial home; the plea of the respondent that he was given assurance by the appellant that she would come and join the matrimonial home is palpably false as the appellant had appeared before the concerned court to contest the petition filed by the respondent under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act while the respondent chose not to appear on two dates which ultimately led to the dismissal of the said petition; the appellant never refused to join the company of the respondent and therefore the respondent miserably failed to prove one of the essential ingredients, \xe2\x80\x9eanimus deserendi\xe2\x80\x9f to prove the ground of desertion; the appellant on the other hand successfully proved that she left the matrimonial home due to merciless beatings given by the respondent husband, therefore by granting a decree of divorce in favour of the respondent, the learned trial court has given advantage to the respondent husband to take benefit of his own wrongs'

b' His grievance in appeal is that his objections, though noted, were not addressed/considered by the Magistrate'
b'The Magistrate in the impugned order skirted around the issues raised by the husband and observed that it is "moral" and "legal" duty of the husband to maintain the wife and proceeded to decide on the quantum of such allowance'
b'The \'Objects and Reasons\' leading to the legislation in the Domestic Violence Act makes it clear that it was enacted to "provide a remedy in the civil law" in as much as the then existing civil law would not address the phenomenon of domestic violence in its entirety'
b'In this view of the matter, the submission of the husband that the wife is not entitled to receive such allowance for maintenance or interim maintenance because she was refusing to live with him "without any sufficient reason", cannot be brushed aside as irrelevant since that would be an important issue to be addressed in deciding on her entitlement [Section 125( 4) Cr'

b' The Commission in a unanimously adopted resolution took note of these principles which address the specific needs of internally displaced persons worldwide and identify rights and guarantees relevant to the protection of persons from forced displacement and to their protection and assistance during displacement as well as during return or resettlement and reintegration'
b' Consideration of the petitioners\xe2\x80\x9f rights, therefore, would necessarily involve ensuring the objectives and declarations made in the above international instruments especially those endorsed by India reiterated by the Guiding Principles for IDPs'
b'15239/2004 Page 52 of 157 Q Whether the statutory provisions of Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 which would have the effect of defeating the constitutional rights of the petitioners, could be validly invoked against them? 58'
b' They are therefore in unauthorised occupation of the Government accommodation and therefore liable to be evicted under the provisions of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971'
b' For the reason that the state government was attempting to evict these occupants without providing them with alternative accommodations, a challenge was laid to the judgment of the Single Judge dated the 24th of January, 1997 by a letters patent appeal'
b' Proceedings for his eviction were also initiated by the respondents under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971'

b' It was held that principles of estoppel, res judicata, legitimate expectation or fairness in action were not attracted on the facts of the case'
b' For the purposes of the instant case, the expression "unauthorized occupation" as defined under section 2(g) of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 has to be construed'
b' Despite this hard reality, the representations, undertakings and promises of the Central Government, upon retirement, the allotments to the petitioners stand cancelled and they are being asked to vacate Government accommodation; otherwise they face the threat of eminent forcible eviction therefrom pursuant to proceedings taken against them under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971'
b' The situation which was to be addressed in these cases was truly exceptional'
b' It, therefore, has to be held that the occupation by petitioners cannot be construed as "unauthorized occupation" of the quarters within the meaning of the expression in Section 2(g) of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971'
b' The scheme of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 shows that the notice which is issued under Section 4 to show cause is required to specify the grounds on which the eviction is proposed to be made and require the persons concerned to show cause against the proposed order before the specified date when they are to produce evidence in support of the show cause'
b' Having regard to the drastic violation which results from the impugned action and orders, it has to be held that the decision of the authorities to cancel the allotments and proceed for eviction as well as the impugned orders against the petitioners are not in accordance with law even on reasonable assessment of proportionality viz-a-viz the object of eviction of unauthorised occupants of the Public Premises Act, 1971'

b" The decision taken to cancel the petitioners' allotments and to initiate proceedings under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 without making available of alternative shelter clearly suggests a drastic change in the government policy so far as these IDPs are concerned"
b' The decision to treat the petitioners as unauthorized occupants without their resettlement is clearly not premised a change of policy upon application of mind and therefore not sustainable'
b' It is urged that the respondents have heartily engaged with and manifested extreme concern for refugees from other countries, but have handled inadequately, and even failed to address the difficulties of internally displaced persons'
b' Unlike the Chakmas, the petitioners are IDPs who complain of violation of the same rights and seek redressal thereof'
b' The Central Government has not been able to adequately address the several issues which have been raised'

b' Without meaningfully complying with this order, the respondents have taken recourse to the proceedings under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971'
b' In view of the above discussion, absent any alternative; the admitted failure of the respondents to protect the constitutional rights of the petitioner and the threats which subsist in case they were compelled to return to their State; given the arbitrary and wrongful failure to exercise the discretion under the SR-317 B-25 of the Allotment of Government Residences (General Pool in Delhi) Rules, 1963 in favour of the petitioners; the drastic violation of the fundamental and basic human rights of the petitioner which results upon such implementation of the statutory provisions; keeping view the schemes of rehabilitation and resettlement of Kashmiri migrants of the respondents, and also the several judicial precedents and administrative orders in respect of similarly placed persons, the action of the respondents in treating the petitioners as unauthorised occupants and proceeding against them under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 was completely misdirected and unwarranted'
b' The decision to treat the petitioners as unauthorized occupants and proceed against them under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 as well as the impugned orders are in violation of the constitutional guarantees and basic human rights of the petitioners, and do not show application of mind to relevant material or consideration thereof'
b' In this background, while allowing the writ petitions and having regard to the number of the petitions which have been unnecessarily generated and the lack of material with regard to the persons responsible for the unfortunate decision making, only the litigation costs of the present cases are being awarded'
b' Result In view of the above discussion, it is directed as follows (i) The impugned orders cancelling the allotment of the petitioners; the orders of eviction passed in the proceedings held against the petitioners under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act and the appellate orders which are detailed in para 13 are hereby set aside and quashed'

b' It will be recalled that SI Jai Bhagwan (PW 7) stated that "duty constable of the hospital produced before me two sealed parcels containing the petticoat and slide" The MLC of the prosecutrix clearly therefore, does not support the version of the police that two sealed parcels containing the clothes of the prosecutrix and the slides were handed over to SI Jai Bhagwan by the duty constable at the hospital and deposited at the police malkhana by the latter'
b' What was sent to the FSL was a petticoat allegedly worn by the prosecutrix'

b' PW 3 has clearly stated that Sateesh Chandra Sharma was murdered and was buried in the field of Het Singh in a pit 5 - 6 feet deep at the direction of Latoori Singh along with his clothes and other belongings such as Kurta, tahamad, baniyain, Jersey and shoes'
b' At that time the deceased was wearing clothes and other belongings which were identified by this witness as Exhibit 1 to Exhibit 5 and the rope which was used for the said purpose was Exhibit 7'
b' We find that although the learned counsel for the appellants did argue that the clothes which are alleged to have been recovered and have been exhibited and are being said to belong to the deceased, were not in recognisable condition as they were badly soiled and in torn condition, but we find that even if the testimony of PW 3 and Phool Shri (PW 6), be kept apart with respect to the fact that they had witnessed the burial of the deceased and therefore being the persons who had immediately prior to murder of the deceased and his being buried had seen what he was wearing, hence they could be in a better position to identify the belongings, we find that the other witnesses who have been examined from the prosecution side have given no less important evidence in respect of recognising the dead body on the basis of personal belongings of the deceased to be that of Sateesh Chandra Sharma, because PW 4 is a witness who is alleged to have remained present when the deceased was kidnapped and therefore he knew what he was wearing then and therefore he was also in a position to identify him through his belongings'
b" Next argument before the trial court was that there was material contradiction in the statement of witnesses, which makes testimony of the witnesses unbelievable such as that of PW-3 who had stated that the deceased was wearing 'Tehmat' while PW-6 stated that he was wearing half 'Dhoti'"
b" Repelling this argument from the side of the prosecution, it was stated that the deceased was wearing 'Tehmat' which also stood corroborated by other independent witnesses and in place of 'Tehmat' PW-6 stated that he was wearing half 'Dhoti' that could not be treated to be a contradiction of much significance because both appeared to be the same"
b' Since all the four petitions arise from the same investigative process, they were brought together for consideration of the contentions urged by both sides they necessarily overlapping each other'
b' Further, only because there are restrictions regulating the power of arrest in a cognizable case, or because there are certain pre-requisites to the taking of cognizance - say, filing of a complaint - it does not necessarily lead to the inference, unless there is a statutory provision to such effect, that the empowered agency cannot investigate or arrest without authorization from the court'
b' A probe of this nature requires due circumspection in as much as the initial suspicions may not necessarily be correct'

b' State of Punjab reported as (2000) 5 SCC 207 has been relied upon and the abrasions on face, lips, wrist, which were antemortem in nature, as mentioned in the autopsy report, were sufficient to establish the resulting cruelty soon before the death of the deceased and in these circumstances, presumption u/s 113B of the Indian Evidence Act has arisen and the accused have failed to rebut the same'
b' Coming to the aspect of injuries found on the dead body of the deceased as per autopsy report Ex'
b' The four abrasions mentioned in the autopsy report were found on right wrist of the size SC No'
b' To appreciate the deposition of the autopsy surgeon PW17 and the autopsy report, it is necessary to know about the legal status of an autopsy or postmortem examination report under the law of Evidence'
b" It has been consistently held by many Hon'ble High Courts of India that autopsy report is not a substantive piece of evidence and it can be used only for three purposes i"
b' Judging in the light of the said law laid down with regard to the legal status of the autopsy report, this is admitted case of the autopsy surgeon PW17 that he has not mentioned in the autopsy report Ex'
b' Now the question arises as to why the injuries were not mentioned as antemortem in nature either in the autopsy report or in his deposition in the examination in chief, the answer may be either the injuries were not antemortem or he did not appreciated the symptoms and features of antemortem injuries while appreciating those four abrasions'
b' The doubt is as to how he could refresh his memory from the autopsy report Ex'
b' The autopsy surgeon PW17 has mentioned about the ligature mark found on the dead body of the deceased in the present case as an obliquely placed ligature mark present on front and sides of neck anteriorly placed over thyroid cartilage going upward and backwards towards SC No'
b' I can understand that the dissection conducted of the ligature mark and features noted may be sufficient to refresh the memory of the doctor to say that it was antemortem or postmortem in nature, howsoever he might not have written the words "antemortem" in his autopsy report, but there is no such feature noted by the autopsy surgeon about the said other four abrasions so as to say that the same were antemortem in nature'
b' From the point of view of the said medical jurisprudence and the difference between antermortem and postmortem abrasions, neither in the autopsy report Ex'
b'PW17/A nor in the deposition of the autopsy surgeon any such features were noted with regard to said four abrasions so as to say that these were antermortem in nature nor the abrasions were dissected in order to note the said features nor the appearance and changes with the lapse of time between the abrasion received and observed by the doctor at the time of postmortem examination were recorded or noted and thus, there was no material with the autopsy surgeon to answer in cross examination that the said four abrasions were antemortem in nature for the reasons which he would have deposed, if available with him'
b'14/12 Page 79/106 dragged and such kind of abrasions could appear even during the shifting of the dead body or handling of the same after death and even then, they may look like antemortem in nature, but in fact, it is not so and the autopsy surgeon should be careful enough to note down the nature of abrasion so as to determine as to whether the same were antemortem abrasions'
b' The casual manner in which the autopsy in the present case has been carried out and the report Ex'
b' PW17 has opined that time since death was approximately 9 hours and the autopsy was admittedly conducted by him on 14'
b' The contention that the PMR was not challenged earlier holds not much water because the accused has a right to challenge the same at any forum and this trial is undoubtedly one such forum and more appropriate one, because the accused had the opportunity to cross examine the autopsy surgeon only in the trial'
